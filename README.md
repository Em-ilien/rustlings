This repository contains all the exercises of [rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) that I am using for my personal practice.

## What is Rustlings?

Rustlings is a collection of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. It's an excellent resource for learning the Rust programming language through hands-on practice.

The exercises cover various aspects of Rust, including syntax, data structures, error handling, and more. By working through these exercises, you will gain a deeper understanding of Rust's features and how to use them effectively in your own projects.

You can find the Rustlings repository on GitHub at [rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). The repository includes detailed instructions on how to get started, as well as solutions to the exercises if you get stuck.

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. It was designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but it guarantees memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

Key features of Rust include:

- Ownership system: Ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
- Zero-cost abstractions: High-level features that compile down to low-level code without performance penalties.
- Concurrency: Safe and efficient concurrency support.
- Performance: Comparable to C and C++ in terms of execution speed.

Rust is used in various domains, including web development, systems programming, and embedded systems.
